'Understanding Typescript' course studies

## Contents

- Folders have been enumerated in order of which they were added

- Folders with a `0-` prefix are the most important contents

## Notes in Code

- To visualize notes right next to their example implementations that are scattered throughout this repository, I'd recommend using the VS Code extension 'Todo Tree', and then just filter for any comment with a 'NOTE' prefix to it.

- You can also just search for 'NOTE ' (case sensitive and with the one whitespace afterwards) in the IDE of your choice and it should show every note in the project.
