1)	What's the core idea behind classes?
	
		--	Classes are blueprints for JS objects.

2)	What's a class property?

		--	Essentially a variable in a class

3)	What's the idea of the private and public modifiers?

		--	Private marks properties as "not acessible from outside the class"

4)	How can you shorten the following code in the best possible way?

		class Product {
		  title: string;
		  price: number;
		  private isListed: boolean;
		 
		  constructor(name: string, pr: number) {
		    this.title = name;
		    this.price = pr;
		    this.isListed = true;
		  }
		}

		--	class Product {
			  private isListed: boolean;

			  constructor(public title: string, public price: number) {
			    this.isListed = true
			  }
		}
