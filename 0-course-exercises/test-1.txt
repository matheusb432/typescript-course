1)	Why are "Types" useful and offer an advantage compared to vanilla JavaScript?

	--	Types allow you to detect if data of a wrong type is used or pass around, hence you can avoid unexpected runtime errors.

2)	Will the following code throw a compilation error?

		let userName: string;
		userName = 'Maximilian';
		userName = false;

		--	Yes, userName cannot be assigned to a boolean value since it's assigned to the string type in it's definition.

3)	Does this code rely on type inference?

		const age: number = 29;

		--	No, the type is also assigned explicitly

4)	What's the difference between JavaScript types (e.g. typeof 'Max' => 'string') and TypeScript types (e.g. const name: string = '...')?

	--	TS types are checked in compilation, while JS types are checked only at runtime
