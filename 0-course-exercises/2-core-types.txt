1)	Which of the following snippets could be simplified by using an enum type?

		A)

		const users = ['Max', 'Michael', 'Julie'];
		B)

		const userA = { name: 'Max' };
		const userB = { name: 'Michael' };
		C)

		const ROLE_ADMIN = 0;
		const ROLE_AUTHOR = 1;

		--	C, the enum could be `enum Roles { Admin, Author }`

2)	Will the following code throw a compilation error?

		type User = {name: string; age: number};
		const u1: User = ['Max', 29];

		--	Yes, the `User` type specifies an object with two properties while the assigned type is an array

3)	Will this code make it through compilation?

		type Product = {title: string; price: number;};
		const p1: Product = { title: 'A Book', price: 12.99, isListed: true }

		--	No, isListed is a property that is not included in the `Product` type

4)	Will this code make it through compilation?

		type User = { name: string } | string;
		let u1: User = {name: 'Max'};
		u1 = 'Michael';

		--	Yes, the `User` type specifies that it can be an object with a `name` string prop or just a string, so changing the type after it's first assignment is valid.
